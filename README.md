# Babylon

This is an intentionally weak text scrambler. It ciphers text in such a way that:

- Digits stay digits.
- Capitals stay capital.
- Lowercase stays lowercase.
- Vowels stay vowels.
- Consonants stay consonants.
- Each word is scrambled the same way every time.
- All non-alphanumeric characters stay the same.

This might be useful in an MMORGP to implement language barriers between races.
The text would remain in the same layout and repeated words would be recognizable.
